# CyberLab CTF - Participant Guide

Welcome to the CyberLab Capture The Flag (CTF) competition! This guide will help you get started.

## What is a CTF?

A **Capture The Flag (CTF)** is a cybersecurity competition where you solve challenges to find hidden "flags" - special text strings in the format `CYBERLABFLAG{text_here}`.
